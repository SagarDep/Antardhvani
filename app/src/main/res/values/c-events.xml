		<item>The solo singer has a long tradition in India and the repertoire ranges from the classical to the popular. Although the parameters may be different in each genre there is a quality of voice and expression that may be possible to evaluate across the genres. Built on years of training and honed by regular practice, the singer’s voice is the vital mode for conveying emotion, lyric, skill and finesse. At Antardhvani the jury will keep in mind the enormous range that a vocal solo competition may bring.  The composition may be from classical sources or from a film or private album and may be presented in any official Indian language.  Fusion music is also allowed. The judgment will be made on the basis of voice quality, song selection, rhythm, and melody.
\n\n
Must not exceed 2 minutes.\n
The composition has to be a song either from a Film or Private Album etc in any official Indian language, however fusion is allowed.	\n
The contestant may introduce the composition but it will be mandatory if the song is in language/languages other than Hindi.</item>
		<item>The tradition of Instrumental solo is a venerable one and celebrated in ancient texts and epics of India. Though the sitar, veena, violin and sarod have been most popular, in recent times the classical repertoire includes many instruments some of which had fallen into oblivion. The santoor and the flute for instance saw a revival in the hands of grand masters. The competition at Antardhvani encourages our students to present the fruit of their training in instrumental music, emphasising their creativity, artistry and skill.  No pre-recorded music or sample sound is allowed as accompaniment.
\n\n
Must not exceed 5 minutes</item>
		<item>The Rock Band has its vital links with several forms of popular music and developed from the 1960s to become an immensely attractive genre using primarily the guitar, drums and a vocalist.  Indian rock bands since the 70s have integrated components from western as well as local traditions, and created fusions that are powerful, evocative and vibrant. The advantage of this form of music is that it appeals directly to the viewers and invites their participation in moments of expressions. The portable nature of the band and its adaptability to the environment has a contemporary thrust and the lyrics, often composed by the performers, carry themes that are reflective of modern angst.\n\n
Delhi University groups will be presenting their talent at Antardhvani using minimal facilities so as to bring out their musical creativity to the utmost.
\n\n
Must not exceed 15 minutes</item>
		<item>The vigour of group songs carries an extraordinary energy. All communities in India build a rich collection of traditional group songs that are shared at festive occasions and invoke the participation of the social circle of family and friends. Often linked to seasons and to ritual ceremonies, the songs mark a calendar that records the passage of time and the link with nature. Folk songs in groups have evolved into modern versions in which the patriotic genre took root during the national movement.  In contemporary times, there is a revival of interest in the folk traditions and the circumstances that make the group songs adaptable to social change.  In the competition at Antardhvani, the size of the choir team has been limited. Accompanying instruments are also limited to Harmonium, Keyboard, Tabla, Percussion etc. The judgment will be made on the basis of voice quality, song selection, rhythm, and melody.

		<item>Woven in rhythm, music and movements, folk dances are reflections of culture, traditions and community practices. They are a fervent and ecstatic celebration of life. Countries of the world have numerous folk dance forms – wonderfully expressed through traditional attires, vibrant music and choreography, unique make-up and collective configurations.\n\n
Folk dances are developed by local communities of villages or tribes based on their own regional customs and traditions. India, particularly, has a variety of folk dances, each with its unique specialty and grace.\n\n
This event at Antardhvani aims at showing folk dances of different cultures for the audience to witness the colourful costumes and vivacious dances, inimitable tradition and distinctive heritage.

		<item>Originating in the treatise on Natya Shastra by Bharat, the classical dance in India offers a rich and varied repertoire which has evolved in contemporary times to experiment with themes while retaining the discipline of the rules of performance. Eight classical dance forms are generally recognised of which Kathak, Bharatanatyam and Odissi remain highly popular. Classical dance requires rigorous training from a young age and the best performers are also adept musicians and choreographers.

		<item>Short films are not short because of small budgets or lesser known actors. They are brief because everyone likes short and smart presentations these days. We live in a society with fast food, fast email, fast trains, instant messages and e-shopping. Why not films in a similar mode? These 3-5 minute films offer entertainment served with information, knowledge and wisdom. Film makers have to just bring the magic of their creativity through their favourite device that is the mobile phone. It needs a special talent to capture something unique in the university on that mobile and create a narrative.

		<item>Welcome to the world of colours by participating in a Rangoli competition. It is an integral part of Indian culture and folk art of India. Decorative designs in the form of Rangoli are made during different Hindu festivals and other auspicious occasions. Layouts are typically created using a variety of material including coloured rice, coloured dry flour, dry sand, dals, spices and even flower petals. Rangoli is called by different names in Indian states: Kolam in Tamil Nadu, Mandana is Rajasthan, Chowkpurna in Northern India, Alpana in West Bengal, Aripana in Bihar and Chowkpujan in Uttar Pradesh etc. Though Rangoli is usually prepared for the purpose of decoration, it is also thought to bring good luck.

		<item>Street Theatre is a popular activity in the University. It aims at sensitizing masses to social issues, enrolling them in the process of social change and promoting deeper understanding. It does not necessarily provide answers to the issues raised but tries to analyse the problems. Using humour it gives a satirical view on current issues. Street Theatre entails minimalist techniques. A character is established with a small but significant item of property such as a stick to portray a policeman, which can even be used as a shehnai, a chair to portray the study room or a group of students to represent society. The actor achieves success with his/her voice, body language and eye-to-eye contact with the viewer. Street Theatre combines music, song and dance with dialogues.
Street Theatre is people-friendly. The dynamic and mobile nature of street theatre, makes it possible to go to people where a stage  is not accessible, such as on  streets and at  markets, slums, villages, schools, office complexes, parks and  residential areas. It is a free show for everyone, be it a shopkeeper, an officer, a housewife or a student; therefore, it never has a repeat audience. With participants sitting at the same level as the audience, it shuns hierarchy. The unpolished performance gives it the power to reach people. Street Theatre helps not only actors to evolve but also the audience to understand its social context.
\n\n
Maximum time is 15 minutes per entry. Socially relevant themes will be presented in Hindi or English. The aesthetics and language should be appropriate. Size of team is limited to 15 persons per team.\n\n
